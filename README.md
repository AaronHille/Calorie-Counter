# Calorie-Counter
Personal calorie counter program that may be developed into an app for my phone for ease of use.

This repository utilises the MIT lisence.

This program will be a [personal] calorie counter. I may make it into an app in the future so I can use it on my phone as well.
Later on, once I have the program working properly and to my standards, I may have it connect to the internet for ISBN numbers and barcode scanning.
Or I will make a [custom] database that gets added to over time by using ISBN number inputs to save certain items.
The program will have a BMI calculator and goal setters to better help track your personal progress whilst calorie counting.
I could also add a feature that helps track your runs, allowing you to enter in the distance and time of the run. This will help with calorie and weight goals.
